Here is a tip, I don't know why, but I almost always forgot how to do that.

When you want to launch a command and this command should not be killed after you close your terminal. Here is how to accomplish that from command line: 

~~~ {.zsh}
nohup cmd &
~~~

<small>where <code>cmd</code> is your command.</small>

I let this command here for me and I wish it could also help someone.
